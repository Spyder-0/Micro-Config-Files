# Micro Config Files
My Micro Text Editor Config Files. Feel free to use them as you like! The theme used here is [`Catppuccin Mocha`](https://github.com/catppuccin/micro). Check out their repo if you only want the theme. Micro is a text editor in between GNU nano and VIM, so it's pretty easy to learn and use :)

# Downloading
If you want to use these configs, follow these steps: <br />
1. Download the [`micro`](https://github.com/SpyderGamer/Micro-Config-Files/tree/main/micro) folder and place it in this directory `~/.config`.
2. Add this line to your .bashrc or .zshrc etc: `export "MICRO_TRUECOLOR=1"`. (Restart your terminal in order for this to work).
3. Now run Micro in your terminal and enjoy your new look!
